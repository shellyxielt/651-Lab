ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

The project mainly focuses on designing a web page about my personal interests. It consists of 4 .html files.

The main web page is called My Webpage.html, where you can get access to the other three .html files (Music.html, Video.html and Handicraft.html) from the three hyperlink respectively. The background color of these websites will change when they shrink or expand to a certain extent.

Music.html mainly shows my favorite singers and their information. The hyperlink of three of my commonly used music websites are also shown on the page.

Video.html shows the information of my commonly used video websites. You can get access to these websites through the "Getting Started!" button on the bottom of each card. 

Handicrafts.html shows the kinds of handicrafts I have tried before and the photos of my work.
